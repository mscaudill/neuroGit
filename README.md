# neuroGit -  A suite of matlabÂ© packages for visual neuroscience. 

## STIMULUS-DELIVERY
______

The stimulus-delivery directory contains a gui called StimGen and supporting helper functions for generating and drawing visual stimulus to a monitor. The package creates a trials structure containing all the stimulus information for a particular trial specified by the gui inputs provided by the user.

The package supports parallel port triggering on the following computer architectures: 32-bit and 64-bit Windows XP and Windows 7. This allows users to engage data acquistions systems with millisecond accuracy. A range of possible stimuli are provided in the stimGenStimuli directory. The framework is modular with expemplary code annotation to aid developers in creating new stimuli.The software is free to use under a public license. If used, please cite this repository. 

## DATA-ANALYSIS

**EPHYS:** 
An electrophysiology analysis package for cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from single cells. It supports both matlab DAQ and axoclamp ABF file types. The gui walks the user through the following processing stages:
- Data Selection 
- Filtering - IIR filters include Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Elliptic
- Spike detection
- Results 

The package seamlessly integrates with the stimGen visual stimulation
software by joining individual stimulus trials with their corresponding
electrophysiology traces. Finally, the package allows for assesment of
behavior such as running during the trials. This package is free to use
under a public license. If used, please cite this repository.

**CAIMG:** 

imExpMaker
- Data Selection - includes filtering by behavior options
- Motion Correction

imExpAnalyzer
- Roi Selection
- Computes percentage change of Fluoresence 
- Variable neuropil contribution

4. An intrinsic imaging package for analyzing hemodynamic flow in response to stimuli. Currently supports only tiff format images

# neuroGit -  A suite of matlabÂ© packages for visual neuroscience. 

## STIMULUS-DELIVERY
______

The stimulus-delivery directory contains a gui called StimGen and supporting helper functions for generating and drawing visual stimulus to a monitor. The package creates a trials structure containing all the stimulus information for a particular trial specified by the gui inputs provided by the user.

The package supports parallel port triggering on the following computer architectures: 32-bit and 64-bit Windows XP and Windows 7. This allows users to engage data acquistions systems with millisecond accuracy. A range of possible stimuli are provided in the stimGenStimuli directory. The framework is modular with expemplary code annotation to aid developers in creating new stimuli.The software is free to use under a public license. If used, please cite this repository. 

## DATA-ANALYSIS

**EPHYS:** 

An electrophysiology analysis package for cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from single cells. It supports both matlab DAQ and axoclamp ABF file types. The gui walks the user through the following processing stages:
- Data Selection 
- Filtering - IIR filters include Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Elliptic
- Spike detection
- Results 

The package seamlessly integrates with the stimGen visual stimulation
software by joining individual stimulus trials with their corresponding
electrophysiology traces. Finally, the package allows for assesment of
behavior such as running during the trials. This package is free to use
under a public license. If used, please cite this repository.

**CAIMG:** 
CAIMG is an extensive package for calcium indicator response analysis. Two
guis and supporting helper functions seamlessly integrate visual stimuli
from the stimGen package with imaging stacks collected using two-photon
microscopy running scan-image software. The guis and the functionality they
provide are:

*imExpMaker*
- Data Selection and Visualization
- Autodetection of missed triggers
- Motion Correction
- Support for separating optogenetic and control trials

**imExpAnalyzer**
- Region of interest (ROI) selection
- Fluoresence calculations with neuropil subtraction
- Support for separating calculations of optogenetic and control trials

After regions of interest have been drawn the analyzer returns the core data
structure used in all analysis--the signalMap. This is a map container
object that holds all the stimulus information and the signals for each
individual roi. This container object makes it easy to carry out further
calculations on the fluoresence signals from each roi. The package includes
numerous scripts that demonstrate the interaction with the signal map
object.

4. An intrinsic imaging package for analyzing hemodynamic flow in response to stimuli. Currently supports only tiff format images

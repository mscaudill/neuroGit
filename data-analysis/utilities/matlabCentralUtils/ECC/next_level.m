function warp=next_level(warp_in, transform, high_flag)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%WARP=NEXT_LEVEL(WARP_IN, TRANSFORM, HIGH_FLAG)
% This function modifies appropriately the WARP values in order to apply
% the warp in the next level. If HIGH_FLAG is equal to 1, the function
% makes the warp appropriate for the next level of higher resolution. If
% HIGH_FLAG is equal to 0, the function makes the warp appropriate
% for the previous level of lower resolution.
%
% Input variables:
% WARP_IN:      the current warp transform,
% TRANSFORM:    the type of adopted transform, accepted strings:
%               'tranlation','affine' and 'homography'.
% HIGH_FLAG:    The flag which defines the 'next' level. 1 means that the
%               the next level is a higher resolution level,
%               while 0 means that it is a lower resolution level.
% Output:
% WARP:         the next-level warp transform
